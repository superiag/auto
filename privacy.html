  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: November 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Super IAG Autoposting</strong> collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our application.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Access</h2>
  <p>The application only accesses data that you authorize via TikTok’s OAuth2 flow, such as basic user profile information and permissions required to upload videos. We do not access, collect, or store personal data outside what is necessary for API operation.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>No user credentials or personal data are stored permanently. OAuth tokens are securely held only during the active session to perform the requested API actions (e.g., video posting).</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Our app connects with external services (TikTok, YouTube, etc.) through official APIs. Each service has its own privacy policy governing data handling and user information.</p>

  <h2>4. Security</h2>
  <p>We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your data against unauthorized access or misuse.</p>

  <h2>5. User Control</h2>
  <p>You can revoke the application’s access at any time through your TikTok account settings. Once revoked, the app will no longer be able to access your data.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@superiag.app">contact@superiag.app</a>.</p>
